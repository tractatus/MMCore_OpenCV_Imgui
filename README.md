I still havent completely made the compilation of MMCore entirely into CMake so just download the orignal micromanager source code and compile it through their `automake` instructions.

### Installation

Step 1-3 follows the compilation advice for MicroManager Java which compiles MMDevice and makes makefile for MMCore.
After compiling take the entire folder `mmCoreAndDevices` and place in this directory.

1. Download MicroManager [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Compile MicroManager
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run CMake on our program
   ```sh
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Run make
   ```sh
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Enjoy!
   ```sh
   ./micromanager
   ```
